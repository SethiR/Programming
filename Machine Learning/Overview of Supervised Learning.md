# Overview of Supervised Learning


__Output Types__

- Quantitative
- Qualitative e.g. ${0,1,2}$

__Prediction Task__

- Regression - we predict quantitative
- Classification - we predict qualitative


__Input Types__

- Quantitative inputs
- Qualitative inputs - Typically represented by codes. e.g. ${0, 1}$. Most common encoding is dummy variables,  Here a K-level qualitative variable is represented by a vector of K binary variables or bits, only one of which is “on” at a time.
- Ordered categorical - where there is an ordering between the values, but no metric notion - e.g. Small, Medium, Large

## Two simple approaches to prediction

### Linear models and Least Squares

### Nearest Neighbours
