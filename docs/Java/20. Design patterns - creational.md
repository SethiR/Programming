Design Patterns : Creational
============================

Singleton
---------

**Concept**

-   Gaurentees only 1 instance is going to be created
-   Gaurentees the control of the resource
-   Usually lazily loaded
-   Examples

    -   Runtime
    -   Logger
    -   Spring Beans
    -   Graphics Managers

**Design**

-   Static in nature but not static class (because it needs to be thread
    safe)
-   private instance
-   private constructor
-   no params, if params req its a factory pattern and violates rules of
    singleton

```java
// A very basic singletom

class DBSingleton {

    private static DBSingleton instance = new DBSingleton();  // only a single instance

    private DBSingleton(){}  // private constructor

    // the only public method will return that single instance which was created above.
    public static DBSingleton getInstance(){
        return instance;
    }
}
```

Now you can call the above singleton class using main method

```java
public class SingletonDemo{
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        DBSingleton instance = DBSingleton.getInstance();
        System.out.println(instance);  // DBSingleton@4554617c

    }
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lazy loaded**

As of the above demo the singleton is always created whether you use it
or not. Lets make it lazily loaded.

```java
class DBSingleton {

    private static DBSingleton instance = null;

    private DBSingleton(){}  // private constructor

    // the only public method will return that single instance which was created above.
    public static DBSingleton getInstance(){
        if (instance == null){
            instance = new DBSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Thread Safe**

I am not there yet :)

**Pitfalls**

-   overused
-   diffcult to unit test
-   if not careful, not threadsafe
-   sometimes confused for factory

**Contrast**

(check slide) mostly it will be contrasted with Factory method

Builder Pattern
---------------

**Concepts**

-   Handles complex constructors
-   Large no of parameters
-   Immutability
-   Examples

    -   StringBuilder
    -   DocumentBuilder
    -   Locale.Builder

**Design**

The builder pattern solves a common problem where we have permutations
of parameters when a object is being created. So in this case you will
create multiple constructors. The builder pattern simplifies this.

-   Flexibility over telescoping constructors
-   Static inner class
-   Calls appropriate constructors
-   Negates needs of exposed setters

*Demo*

```java
class LunchMenu{
    public String getBread() {
        return bread;
    }

    public String getCheese() {
        return cheese;
    }

    public String getVegges() {
        return vegges;
    }

    public String getMeat() {
        return meat;
    }

    // builder class within the actual lunchmenu class.
    public static class Builder{
        private String bread;
        private String cheese;
        private String vegges;
        private String meat;

        Builder(String bread){  // bread is mandatory in sandwich
            this.bread = bread;
        }


        // rest of these are optionals
        public Builder cheese(String cheese){
            this.cheese = cheese;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder vegees(String vegges){
            this.vegges = vegges;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder meat(String meat){
            this.meat = meat;
            return this;
        }

        public LunchMenu build(){
            return new LunchMenu(this);
        }
    }

    private String bread;
    private String cheese;
    private String vegges;
    private String meat;

    private LunchMenu(Builder builder){
        this.bread = builder.bread;
        this.cheese = builder.cheese;
        this.meat = builder.meat;
        this.vegges = builder.vegges;

    }

}

public class BuilderPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        LunchMenu.Builder builder = new LunchMenu.Builder("Herbs and cheese");
        builder.cheese("swis").meat("chicken");

        LunchMenu sandwhich1 = builder.build();

        System.out.println(sandwhich1.getBread());
        System.out.println(sandwhich1.getCheese());
        System.out.println(sandwhich1.getMeat());
        System.out.println(sandwhich1.getVegges());

    }
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Pitfalls**

Doesn\'t have a lot of negetives, just some things to consider.

-   objects created are generally made to be immutable
-   inner static class is requried
-   little bit more complex

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prototype Design pattern
------------------------

Generally used to create a new instance of the same flavor.

**Concept**

-   When trying to avoid costly creation
-   this will be created when you are refactoring your application.
    (based on performance considerations)
-   avoids subclassing
-   typically dont use the keyword `new`
-   often utilizes an Interface
-   usually implemented with some type of registry
-   when another object is needed we create a clone of that with the
    registry
-   Example

    -   java.lang.Object --\> clone() method

If the example is expensive to create then we just copy the memeber
variables and create the object. It typically implements the Cloneable
interface with method clone. Can utilize parameters for construction but
you typicall dont. There are shallow vs deep copy.

// TODO

Factory Method Pattern
----------------------

**Concept**

-   This does not expose instanciation logic
-   It defers the instanciation to its subclass
-   A common interface is exposed
-   often implemented by framework, where the user of the framwork uses
    this and customizes it
-   Examples

    -   Calendar
    -   Resource Bundle
    -   Number format
