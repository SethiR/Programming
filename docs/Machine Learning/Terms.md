# Model Parameters

They are learned or estimated from the data.
e.g. 
- Weights in neural network
- The coefficients in a linear regression or logistic regression.


# Model Hyperparamters

These are external to the model whose value cannot be estimated from the data. Define higher level concepts about the model such as complexity, or capacity to learn. 

e.g.
- Learning rate.
- Number of hidden layers in deep neural network.

# Cross Entropy


# Variance

# Bias 

# Standardization

Makes the mean as 0 and standard deviation as 1. $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$ This does not change the distribution of the data.

# Min Max - Normalization

Scales the values to $[0,1]$ --> $\frac{x-x_{min}}{max_x - min_x}$
